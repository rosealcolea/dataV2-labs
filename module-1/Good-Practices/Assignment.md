# Lab | Good Practices

## Introduction
This document defines the good practices that me and your team will follow during our third project.

Find the full guide [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements):

## Code Lay-out
* Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
* The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs will line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list.
* Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
* Displayed formulas always break before binary operations.

## Whitespace
* No whitespace immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.
* No whitespace immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon
* No whiteespace immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call, and indexing or slicing.
* No more than one space around an operator.
* When operators with different priorities are used, add whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies)
> # Example:
>i = i + 1
>submitted += 1
>x = x*2 - 1
>hypot2 = x*x + y*y
>c = (a+b) * (a-b)

* Don't use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument.

## Comments
* Block comments generally apply to code that follows them.
* They are indented to the same level as that code.
* The are indented to the same level as that code.
* Use inline comments sparingly.
