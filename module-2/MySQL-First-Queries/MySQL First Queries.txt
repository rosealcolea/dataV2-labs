**7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.**

Here we can find the most popular apps. All the apps on this list are familiar to me.

**8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.**

Here we can find the highest rated apps. Most of the apps on this list are unknown to me.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

The top 10 from Q.6 is different than in the previous questions because we are filtering through rating, aka highest rated.
A lower quantity of ratings makes it easier to acheive high total ratings, therefore it in not unusual to see a difference between both lists.

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?**

SELECT track_name FROM IHAMSFT.app ORDER BY rating_count_tot, user_rating DESC LIMIT 10

**11. Do people care about the price of an app?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

I think people do care about the price of an app. 
I compared the most expensive apps and their popularity against other cheaper apps
